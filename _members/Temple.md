Temple Maduoma is a graduate researcher with a bachelor's degree in chemical Engineering. He has extensive research experience in both experimental and computational studies, which have led to several publications in corrosion control, biomaterial optimization, sustainable fuel production, eco-friendly water treatment, and computational modelling of infectious diseases. 

Temple is a prestigious fellow of the 2025 Diverse Intelligences Summer Institute (DISI) fellowship, funded by the Templeton World Charity Foundation and Indiana University Bloomington, held at the University of St Andrews, Scotland; a fellow of the Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI); and an active member of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE), the Nigerian Society of Chemical Engineers (NSChE), and Black in AI.

His work on wastewater remediation was recognized by the African Academy of Engineering as a "transformative approach to low-cost purification" and documented in his co-authorship of the Archives of Advanced Engineering Science study that achieved 90% lead and cadmium removal efficiency from pharmaceutical effluent using functionalized fluted pumpkin stem bioadsorbents.
