Ransom Uwakwem is a graduate researcher with two years of experience in the Environmental, Composite, and Optimization (ECO) Research Group at the Federal University of Technology Owerri (FUTO). His research in the group has focused on sustainable materials and advanced electrochemical processes aimed at solving challenges in energy, electronics and the environment.

At ECO, he has worked on projects involving nanomaterials for sodium-ion batteries, the recovery of critical metals from spent batteries using bio-derived reagents, Sulphur cathodes for Lithium-ion batteries and the electrochemical degradation of pollutants. Through these efforts, he has gained extensive experience in nanomaterials and electrode synthesis/analysis, structural and surface characterization, and electrochemical testing. His academic interests lie in Energy Materials, nanomaterials, and 2D Materials, with a focus on how surface chemistry, interfaces, composites and structural design govern performance. 

Ransom has demonstrated initiative and leadership in collaborative projects, often coordinating with peers to drive progress and communicate results effectively. Outside the laboratory, he actively pursues his interest in languages, both learning and teaching, reflecting his curiosity and commitment to knowledge exchange.
