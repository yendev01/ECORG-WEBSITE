Ransom Uwakwem is a graduate researcher with two years of experience in the Environmental, Composite, and Optimization (ECO) Research Group at the Federal University of Technology Owerri (FUTO). His research in the group has focused on sustainable materials and advanced electrochemical processes aimed at solving challenges in electronics, energy and the environment.

At ECO, he has worked on projects involving nanomaterials for sodium-ion and lithium-ion batteries, the recovery of critical metals from spent batteries using bio-derived reagents, and the electrochemical degradation of pollutants. Through these efforts, he has gained extensive experience in nanomaterials synthesis, structural and surface characterization, and electrochemical testing.

His academic interests lie in nanomaterials, nanocrystals, graphene, and composites, with particular focus on how surface chemistry, interfaces, and structural design govern performance. He is especially interested in colloidal nanocrystals for their synthetic versatility and potential in scalable applications.

Ransom is motivated, curious, and has great leadership qualities. When he is not working on projects, he is out there learning and teaching languages.
