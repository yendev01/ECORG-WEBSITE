Akomah Ugochukwu is a Research Assistant with a background in Chemical Engineering and a strong focus on sustainability-driven innovation. His undergraduate thesis on the optimization of biodegradable chitosan–glycerol bioplastics from waste potato peels reflects his early commitment to circular economy solutions and waste valorization. He has since expanded his research to address global environmental challenges at the intersection of microplastics and PFAS pollution, bioproducts engineering, and advanced environmental remediation techniques.

He is a recipient of prestigious awards and scholarships including the NNPC/TOTAL and Nigerian LNG scholarships, and has interned with Nigeria’s energy titan, NNPC Ltd, and global oilfield services leader, SLB (formerly Schlumberger), where he contributed to sustainable practices and carbon emission reduction initiatives. Beyond technical work, he has held leadership and public speaking roles through platforms such as the Nigerian Institution of Environmental Engineers (NIEE) and also an active member of the Nigerian Society of Chemical Engineers (NSChE) and the International Association of Engineers (IAENG), continually expanding his professional network and impact, while championing science communication and environmental advocacy.

His recent research efforts explore low-cost bio-based adsorbents for removing persistent pollutants, plastic-to-biomaterial remediation, and sustainable waste-to-resource technologies that support a circular economy transition. He is particularly interested in integrating environmental engineering with biomaterials science and hydrology to create scalable solutions for pollution control and resource recovery in emerging economies.

He seeks to pursue a Ph.D. in Environmental and Sustainability Engineering, ultimately becoming a professor and research leader. His vision is to pioneer affordable, high-impact technologies that safeguard ecosystems, promote resource circularity, and accelerate the global shift toward a sustainable future.
