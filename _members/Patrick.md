Dr. UGOCHUKWU PATRICK OKOYE received his B.Eng. degree in Chemical Engineering from Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Nigeria, in 2009, his M.Sc. degree in Applied Process Control from the University of Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK with distinction, in 2012, and his PhD degree in Chemical Engineering from Universiti Sains Malaysia, Malaysia, in 2017 with Distinction. He worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow at Shenyang University of Technology, China. 

Currently, Patrick is an Associate Professor at the [**Institute of Renewable Energy, National Autonomous University of Mexico.**](https://www.ier.unam.mx/) Patrick is interested in research and technology that will result in a sustainable solution to today's energy and environmental pollution challenges. His main research focus is waste valorization to produce porous materials that can be applied in heterogeneous catalysis, biofuels, energy storage, hydrogen storage, fine chemical synthesis, and liquid-phase adsorption processes. Patrick develops curriculum and teaches courses such as Bioenergy, Hydrogen and Energy, Fuel Cells, and Emerging Pollutants at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. He has received and executed fellowships from UNAM for both teaching and basic research. 

Additionally, he participates in the CONACYT CeMIE Sol-UNAM Research and Technology fellowship. He has published 116 scientific articles with a Scopus H-index of 39. His works have been cited for over 4000 times. Patrick is an Editor in Energy Ecology and Environment and Energy Development and Sustainability. He is a member of the Mexican National Research System (SNI) Level. Recently, he was included among the 2% of the most outstanding scientists in the world in a single career category by Stanford University in the United States.
