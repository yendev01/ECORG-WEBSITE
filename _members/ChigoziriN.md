Dr. Njoku is a faculty member at the Department of Chemical Engineering at the Federal University of Technology, Owerri (FUTO). He leads the ECO Research Group with distinguished expertise in sustainable materials science and chemical engineering. He earned both his Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) and Master of Engineering (MEng) degrees in Chemical Engineering from Nnamdi Azikiwe University (UNIZIK) and successfully obtained his PhD from the highly reputable Institute of Metal Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IMR-UCAS China). From 2018 to 2021, he was actively involved in advanced research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, with affiliations with the Nigerian Alumni Association of IMR-CAS (NAAIMCAS) and the Africa Center of Excellence for Future Energies.

Njoku has supervised and mentored over 100 undergraduates, master's, PhD, and postgraduate students. has authored over fifty journal publications. His primary interest is in materials science and engineering, with a focus on corrosion protection and the innovative development of smart coatings, anticorrosion technologies, and sustainable materials. He actively addresses pressing environmental challenges through the strategic optimization of materials for corrosion protection and advanced water treatment solutions. A significant aspect of his work involves the "fabrication of microcapsules for self-healing coatings for corrosion control," a cutting-edge area with substantial industrial implications.

As a recipient of the prestigious TWAS Young Scientist Award and Elsevier Sustainability Science Fellowship and keynote speaker at the International Congress on Green Materials, he serves on the editorial boards of Resources, Conservation & Recycling and Environmental Modelling & Software, and the Journal of Cleaner Production and Sustainable Materials and Technologies. His research has consistently attracted attention and sponsorship from prominent international funding bodies, raising and managing over $30,000 in funding. These include the European Commission, Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund), and African Academy of Sciences.
