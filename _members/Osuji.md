Ihechukwu Osuji is a research assistant with a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering. He is interested in metabolic engineering and sustainable energy production and aims to pursue a PhD in reprogramming microbial pathways for the efficient conversion of lignocellulosic and plastic-derived substrates into renewable biofuels.

He has skills in conducting PRISMA-based systematic reviews, defining inclusion and exclusion criteria, executing comprehensive database searches, and performing full-text screening and data extraction to inform evidence-based conclusions. His experimental work includes optimizing enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation of microwave-assisted deep eutectic solventâ€“pretreated sawdust for bioethanol production, as well as investigating biomass-catalyzed plastic-to-fuel conversion processes.

His long-term aspiration is to become a professor at a leading research university, guiding cutting-edge research that delivers innovative solutions to global energy and waste management challenges.
