Chinenye Oguadinma is a Chemical Engineer and data professional specializing in AI-driven sustainability solutions. Her research focuses on integrating machine learning with environmental engineering to optimize resource recovery processes, demonstrated through publications on biodiesel production optimization and wastewater treatment using composite catalysts.

She has an interdisciplinary background that spans chemical process optimization, business analytics, and social innovation. As former President of Enactus, she led 150+ student entrepreneurs in developing sustainable technology ventures, securing significant funding, and implementing community-impact projects.

Chinenyeâ€™s research interests center on applying artificial intelligence to accelerate circular economy transitions, particularly in resource-constrained environments. I aspire to establish research frameworks that bridge technical optimization with systems change theory, contributing to sustainable transformation through data-driven approaches that address both environmental challenges and economic development needs in emerging contexts.
