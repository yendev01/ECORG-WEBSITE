Cyril Anorondu graduated with a first class in Chemical Engineering from the Federal University of Technology, Owerri, where he cultivated a rigorous foundation in reaction engineering, thermodynamics, transport phenomena, and process optimization. Driven by an early interest in the intersection of technology and responsible development, he joined the Sustainability Centre at Lagos Business School. There, he assisted in research and outreach initiatives that helped local enterprises embed sustainable strategies into their operations—an experience that sharpened both his analytical skills and his commitment to scalable climate solutions.

Building on this momentum, Cyril is now pursuing a PhD in Chemical Engineering at Florida State University. His doctoral research focuses on designing high‑performance and intrinsically safe batteries. By combining advanced electrochemical characterization with multiscale modeling, he aims to deliver next‑generation energy‑storage systems that meet the pressing safety and efficiency demands of electric‑vehicle and grid applications. Passionate about mentorship and community engagement, Cyril also volunteers with programs that introduce undergraduates to clean‑energy research, underscoring his belief that a sustainable future must be both innovative and inclusive.
