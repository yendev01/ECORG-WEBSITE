Martin Chidera Etude is a results-driven Chemical Engineering graduate specializing in sustainable energy technologies, with a strong focus on energy storage systems, electrochemistry, and advanced materials for next-generation batteries. He holds a B.Eng. in Chemical Engineering from the Federal University of Technology, Owerri, graduating with honors and has authored multiple peer-reviewed publications in lithium-ion battery recycling, sulfur cathode synthesis, hydrogen production, and Nanotechnologies.

Currently serving as a Graduate Research Assistant in the Environmental, Composite and Optimization Research Group at FUTO, Martin applies advanced electrochemical and physiochemical characterization techniques (GCD, CV, EIS, XRD, SEM-EDS, FTIR, BET) to investigate sustainable battery materials. His work bridges fundamental research and practical applications, with a proven ability to lead projects from conception to publication.

 Martin’s experience spans academic research, process engineering, and teaching. He has contributed to photovoltaic system optimization at Kiru Energy Ltd., supervised process operations during his industrial internship at PZ Cussons, and taught mathematics and engineering courses to hundreds of students, fostering a strong culture of academic excellence.

Beyond technical expertise, Martin demonstrates exceptional leadership and organizational skills through roles such as Corper Liaison Officer during NYSC, Secretary General of NSChE FUTO, and Chairman of the LOC for a national engineering convention. His volunteer work with the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital’s Barnards-Balance Study Group and the National Population Commission reflects a commitment to applying engineering and analytical skills for societal benefit.

Martin is a Graduate Member of the Nigerian Society of Chemical Engineers and the Nigerian Society of Engineers. His career goal is to pursue a PhD in Chemical Engineering, advancing sustainable energy solutions and bridging the gap between laboratory research and real-world implementation.
