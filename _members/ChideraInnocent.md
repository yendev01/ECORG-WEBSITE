Chidera Innocent (he/him) is a PhD candidate in Chemical Engineering at the Florida State University College of Engineering, working in Dr. B. Locke’s Non-Thermal Plasma Lab. He earned a bachelor’s degree in Chemical Engineering from the Federal University of Technology, Owerri (FUTO), and has also previously worked in software engineering.

Chidera is interested in practical, non-thermal plasma applications for environmental management and semiconductor manufacturing. He enjoys using computational chemistry and modeling alongside well-designed experiments to understand and control reactive species, then turning those insights into processes that are reliable and scalable. He also cares about process modeling, statistical design/analysis, and building reproducible data and instrumentation workflows that speed up experimentation and improve data quality. Additional interests include biomass energy.

His research  goal is to develop plasma-enabled methods that help remove contaminants and reduce chemical and energy use in water treatment, while also enabling precise, high-quality surface processes for the chip industry, advancing cleaner technologies and more efficient manufacturing.
