Ikono Abasiofon is an undergraduate of chemical engineering, inspired by my supervisor, Dr. Njoku, to join the ECO Research group. His current research work is on the protection of metal from corrosion using methionine as an amino based inhibitor, with Hankâ€™s balanced salt solution serving as the corrosive media. 

He aims to contribute meaningfully to the success of the ongoing research work and also to improve and sharpen his research skills, most especially in environmental engineering and renewable energy.
