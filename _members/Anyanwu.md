Chinaecherem Emmanuel Anyanwu is a research assistant at the ECO Research Group and a first-year PhD student in Chemical Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. He earned his Bachelor of Engineering in Chemical Engineering from the Federal University of Technology, Owerri (FUTO), where he built a strong foundation in reaction engineering, process design, simulation, and sustainable engineering solutions.

At FUTO, he led a team in designing a 100,000 metric tons/year acetic anhydride production plant from Nigeria’s Anambra Basin coal reserve, integrating Aspen HYSYS simulations with manual computations, and preparing detailed PFD and P&ID diagrams. Under the mentorship of Professor Kechinyere Oyoh, he also developed interlocking bricks from polymeric waste, enhancing both mechanical strength and environmental sustainability.

Chinaecherem’s research interests center on catalysis, fluid systems, electrochemistry, and materials science, with applications in clean manufacturing, the oil and gas sector, renewable energy, and environmental remediation. His long-term goal is to develop scalable, high-performance technologies that accelerate the global transition to clean energy while addressing the unique challenges faced by energy-limited communities. Outside the lab, he enjoys traveling, exploring new places, meeting people, learning and teaching, and cooking.
