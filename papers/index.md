The ECO (Environmental, Composite and Optimization) Research Group is a multidisciplinary chemical engineering research collective at the Federal University of Technology, Owerri (FUTO). Our group is pioneering innovative investigations of chemical engineering research in green and advanced materials (e.g., nanocomposites, electrochemical energy storage systems, smart coatings, and advanced biomaterials) and optimization of industrial processes to solve pressing global problems.

The global population is growing, and industrial activity is accelerating. As a result, issues like energy security, freshwater scarcity, and infrastructure decay are intensifying. Our work tackles these problems head-on by creating sustainable engineering solutions, from corrosion protection, sustainable materials, water treatment, bioplastics, and waste-to-fuel conversion to battery technology. We also employ advanced optimization techniques (like Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)) to improve chemical processes in pharmaceutical manufacturing, biofuel production, material synthesis, electrochemical energy storage, and environmental remediation.

All of our projects are framed by a mission to protect the environment and benefit society, eventually aspiring to shape cleaner industries and healthier communities through cutting-edge and high-impact innovation.
