  image: images/projects/lng-carrier.jpg
  description: >
    Working in close collaboration with our partners in the Faculty of Finance at Dauphine University we are developing a LLM-based apprach to assess commodity supply and demand market sentiment from news articles. The methodology developed represents a significant improvement upon current approaches with applicability across a diverse range of commodities. Our model seeks to identify subtle market signals and sentiment indicators that conventional methods often miss, providing traders and supply chain analysts with additional insights for decision-making.

- title: Vision-Language-Action Models for AV Scenario Interpretation
  image: images/projects/vla-elm.jpg
  description: >
    TSL is working with Elm Europe, the UK-based subsidiary of Elm Company, a leading Saudi technology group, to develop a visual-language-action model framework for the next generation of autonomous vehicle safety systems. Using multi-modal foundation models, the model can interpret unique situations that AVs may have to encounter, and respond to potential safety hazards in real-time. The project builds on our earlier work on AV simulation and risk metrics, which will be complemented by the VLA framework for real-time decision-making.

  description: >
    TSL was contracted by a major retail property developer, to analyze the impacts of increasing electric vehicle adoption in shopping center parking provision. Using a major London facility as a case study, we developed an agent-based tool of customer behaviours that helped the asset owners understand how the shifting transport landscape affects shopping patterns, car park utilisation, retailer logistics, and ultimately profitability. The accompanying interactive dashboard could be used to design custom adoption scenarios and timelines, model EV charger deployment in parking facilities and assess the scale of investment returns.

  description: >
    The SHIFT consortium was funded by a Â£2m InnovateUK grant with the aim to model the deployment of autonomous vehicles in London and their integration with existing public transport systems. As part of the project, we developed Delosâ€”a bespoke simulation framework for public transport and ridesharingâ€”which now underpins much of our subsequent autonomy research. Our partners at Oxa utilised Delos to evaluate fleet performance under a variety of operational conditions and to stress-test their fleet management platform. Additionally, our team supported TfL in assessing how autonomous vehicle fleets could enhance first/last mile connectivity, thereby extending the reach of London's public transport network.

  description: We developed a stochastic optimisation model for designing city-wide wireless charging infrastructure for electric buses. Our solution addressed the limitations of electric busesâ€”limited driving range and long recharge timesâ€”by proposing Wireless Charging Lanes (WCL) that recharge buses while in motion. The model optimized infrastructure deployment considering various energy consumption scenarios and demonstrated potential annual cost reductions of 24% compared to stationary charging solutions.

  description: >
    TSL collaborated with the Department of Economics at the University of Padova to develop a game-theoretic model for maritime container network design with competing shipping lines. Liner shipping firms in the model make sequential decisions about fleet investment, network design, and freight rates. Our approach combines network optimization techniques with microeconomic principles to characterize market equilibria and evaluate how competition shapes maritime transport networks. This work provides strategic insights for shipping companies operating in competitive environments and has implications for maritime policy and regulation.

    TSL was contracted to develop an optimisation model for a multi-modal logistics strategy for the Thames Tideway tunnelling works, meeting a regulatory requirement to prioritise river barge movements over trucks to reduce emissions and ease road network pressure. Our bespoke solution consolidated deliveries via optimal transport mode selection and just-in-time scheduling, addressing challenges such as tide variations, bridge passage height constraints, traffic congestion, and fluctuating material requirements. The approach integrated GIS modelling, visual operational dependency dashboards, and a custom simulation-optimisation library to enhance decision-making and overall performance.
