    Graduate researcher [Temple Maduoma](/members/Temple.html) represented the ECO Research Group at the 2025 Diverse Intelligences Summer Institute (DISI), a world-class, fully funded fellowship organized by the Templeton World Charity Foundation and Indiana University Bloomington, hosted at the University of St Andrews, Scotland.
    Accepted into the program in May 2025 from a competitive pool of more than 500 global applicants, Temple joined fewer than 30 fellows for a month-long residency in July. 
    During the fellowship, he collaborated with leading thinkers in biology, artificial intelligence, philosophy, and cognitive science to explore the nature of intelligence across biological, artificial, and non-human systems.
    Temple’s research focus during DISI connected directly with ECO’s broader mission, as he investigated the principles of decision-making and adaptability in biological systems, knowledge that could inform the design of smarter biomaterials and regenerative medical devices. 
    His participation on this global platform highlights ECO’s growing reputation for producing interdisciplinary researchers capable of bridging environmental, materials, and biomedical engineering challenges.
